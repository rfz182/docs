## Security

Enable or disable Two Factor Authentication \(2FA\) for your account on a Rocket.Chat server.

When you enable 2FA, you are required to get a key code from an app on your phone, thus increasing security when logging in.

**Note**: 2FA can be turned on and off by the system admin. If you can't find this setting, please contact your system admin.

To enable 2FA, you need to:

* Click the **Enable two-factor authentication** button.
* Use an authentication app, such as Google Authenticator, Authy, or Duo, to scan the QR code. Scanning the QR code displays a six-digit code. Enter the code into Rocket.Chat.
* Copy your backup code somewhere safe if you need to access it in the future without the authentication app. Click **Send** to finish.
* To disable the 2FA, click on **Stop two-factor authentication**.

## Personal Access Tokens

The personal access token section allows the user to create his personal tokens to consume Rocket.Chat API, for example.
