# Connectivity Services

## Introduction

Rocket.Chat Cloud provides a list of features/services such as

* [Rocket.Chat Push Notification Gateway](https://docs.rocket.chat/guides/administrator-guides/notifications/push-notifications#push-gateway)
* [Rocket.Chat Marketplace](https://rocket.chat/marketplace)
* Omnichannel proxy
* Automatic license synchronization 

In order to use those services, Rocket.Chat server must be connected to [cloud.rocket.chat](https://cloud.rocket.chat/). Below are the steps required to connect and synchronize a Rocket.Chat self-hosted server to our cloud infrastructure.
