# WhatsApp Integration / Twilio

Rocket.Chat does not have native integration with WhatsApp. However, it is possible to achieve a basic level of integration by using a third-party tool. In this guide, we'll quickly lay out how to integrate Rocket.Chat with WhatsApp using Twilio's programmable SMS.

## Step 1

Create an account at [Twilio](https://twilio.com/whatsapp/request-access).

## Step 2

Log into your Twilio account. The default landing page is the **Dashboard** for your account. On the left side panel, click on the **All Products and Services** icon to expand it.

Click on **Programmable SMS** and then on **WhatsApp**.

## Step 3

For production purposes, you will need to have your account approved by WhatsApp \(see the **Senders** link on the same section\). In the meantime, you can do the same configuration in the **Sandbox** environment provided by Twilio. Click on **Sandbox.**

On the first section, **Sandbox Configuration**, you'll need to enter your Rocket.Chat server details on the **When a message comes in** field. The format is as follows:

`https://<SERVER_URL>/api/v1/livechat/sms-incoming/twilio`

## Step 4

On the Twilio console, “Programmable SMS Dashboard” -&gt; “Whatsapp” -&gt; “Senders” -&gt; Select the Whatsapp number. This will open the “Configuration” screen, where the webhook configuration must be done in order to connect Twilio to Rocket.Chat Livechat

The webhook must be configured following the steps mentioned at [https://rocket.chat/docs/developer-guides/rest-api/livechat/sms-incoming/\#payload](https://rocket.chat/docs/developer-guides/rest-api/livechat/sms-incoming/#payload). Important: the webhook POST URL should be set only on “WHEN A MESSAGE COMES IN” field

## Step 5

On the Twilio console, go to “Programmable SMS Dashboard” and copy the “ACCOUNT SID” and “AUTH TOKEN”

## Step 6

Go to Rocket.Chat Server -&gt; Administration -&gt; Settings-&gt; SMS -&gt; Set to “Enabled” and select “Twilio” as service

## Step 7

Go to Rocket.Chat Server -&gt; Administration -&gt; Settings -&gt; SMS -&gt; Section “Twilio” and add the “Account SID” and Auth Token you had copied on Step 5. After that, the Livechat+Whatsapp integration will be working properly in both directions.

## Step 8 \(For SaaS customers only\)

For Cloud customers, the file-sharing \(images, audio, videos, etc\) between LiveChat and Whatsapp might not work properly.

To fix this issue go to Settings -&gt; File Upload -&gt; Amazon S3 -&gt; Enable the “Proxy Uploads” setting.

**That's it!**
